    "\n",
    "Before going any further in our processing, we need to remove noise originating from recording default and ambient noise. We'll use a [high-pass filter (HPF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-pass_filter) that is  *an electronic filter that passes signals with a frequency higher than a certain cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies lower than the cutoff frequency* (Wikipedia). To do that, we first need to build a filter among [those available](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/signal.html) and apply the filter to the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we want to smooth the signal by averaging each value with neighboring values, using a small temporal window. To do that, we first need to define the neighboring range (in seconds). Then we define a gaussian signal over this range and centered in the middle and finally we compute the smooth signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will denoise and smooth some signals (n=8) and produce a unique figure showing the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Resampling and  auto-correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we are interested in computing the auto-correlation of the signal, that is, the correlation of the signal by itself. Howewer, since the signal is quite large, you'll need first extract only a few points linearly spread over the signal and only then compute the auto-correlation. After computing the autocorrelation for some signals, start to think of a method to separate adults from juveniles.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. Fitting and sorting\n",
