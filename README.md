# Computational Neuroscience Crash Course
**Arthur Leblois (CNRS) & Nicolas P. Rougier (Inria)**

Given the increasing complexity of neural data and the generalized use of theoretical
models in neuroscience, more and more neuroscientists rely on computationnal tools for
modelling or data analysis. We would like to offer the possibility to those who feel that
their maths/informatics background is a bit short to update their maths and to get familiar
with basic techniques for data analysis/modelling. The course will span over two years, with
a first part (2019) focusing on the maths and programming pre-requisites, and a second part
next year (2020) on data analysis (and possibly modelling to follow). The course is open to
everyone (student, post-docs, researchers...) but we'll give priority to **master and PhD
students** given the limited number of places. Just send us an email to subscribe if you're
interested.

For all courses (maths and programming), we'll provide some theoretical background, provide
small exercices for participant to work on their own and then solve the exercices together
and make sure everybody has acquiered the related concepts and techniques. **Courses will
be taught in English.**

## Program

### Starters

#### Linear Algebra

This course will introduce vectors and matrices, how to peform operations such as
addition & multiplication on these objects and the correspondence with geometry
and the resolution of a system of linear equations. Exercises will be given for
the next lesson.

**April 12, 2019 (9:30-11:30)** **Differential Equations.** We'll first correct exercises
from the previous lesson then we'll cover first-order differential equations (that can
for example describe the evolution of a membrane potential). We'll see how to analyze and
solve such equation. Exercises will be given for the next lesson.

**April 26, 2019 (9:30-11:30)** **Signal Processing.** We'll first correct exercises from
the previous lesson then we'll explain first what is the Fourier transform that is
ubiquituous in signal processing, what is spectral analysis and how to compute correlation
in order to reveal similarity between signals. Instruction on how to install Python on
your machine will be given.
